# RamanujanSquare

In recreational mathematics, a magic square of order n is an arrangement of n2 numbers, usually distinct integers, in a square, such that the n numbers in all rows, all columns, and both diagonals sum to the same constant. A normal magic square contains the integers from 1 to n2. The term “magic square” is also sometimes used to refer to any of various types of word square. Below we present to you an unique magic square contributed by Mr. T. R. Jothilingam and his sons. He is a Station Master in Southern Railways, in Kudal Nagar, Madurai, in South India. He graduated in Maths in 1974. He also maintains the website Jolly Maths, which has many such interesting things.
